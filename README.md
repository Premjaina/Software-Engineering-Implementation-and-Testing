#WEEK 3 


Question 1
An interface abstracts a module. Abstraction helps most in reducing the complexity of:

Ans: understanding the system.



Question 2
An interface encapsulates a module. Encapsulation helps most in reducing the complexity of:

maintaining the system.


Question 3

Ans: help us deal with the complexity of a problem.


Question 4
Defensive programming means that you

Ans: do not let input data crash your program


Question 5
The primary purpose of refactoring code is to

Ans: improve the internal structure of the code.





#WEEK 4


Question 1
In the UML the multiplicity of an association specifies

Ans: the number of objects that must/can be related.


Question 2
Could reviews or inspections be considered part of testing?

Ans: Yes, because both help detect faults and improve quality.


Question 3
The cost of fixing a fault

Ans: increases as we move the product towards live use.


Question 4
Which of the following statement about early test design is false?

Ans: Early test design takes more effort.


Question 5
Which of the following is NOT a configuration management activity?

Ans: risk management




#WEEK 5

Question 3
Basis path testing ensures that we have tested at least

Ans: all the statements in a program.


Question 4
_____ focuses on whether we have built the software right in such a way that each function works correctly and has no defects.

Ans: Verification Testing


Question 5
_____ focuses on whether we have built the right software in such a way that it meets the stated requirements.

Ans: Validation Testing





#WEEK 6



Question 1
Testing every statement in a program guarantees that all defects (bugs) will be found.

Ans: No, no way!!


Question 2
The purpose of software testing is to show that
